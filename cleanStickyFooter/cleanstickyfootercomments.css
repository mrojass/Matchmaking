In this block we are going to do the following: Set the width of the wrapper to 100% (not required but semantically makes sense because the footer is at the same level and is at a width of 100%, also useful if you want a header that is a width of 100%, you would contain the header inside of div#wrapper), Give the wrapper a min-height of 100% (min-height doesn't work well in IE6 and older browsers like it so we are going to next set the height to auto and make sure it has the !important flag so our new browsers don't pick up on the next line). In the next like we are simply using height: 100%, it will act as min height in the older browsers because older browsers allow expanding heights. Then we are going to set a bottom margin to the negative version of the height of the footer. In our case the footer is 41px high, so our bottom margin is -41px.
